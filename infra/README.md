# Deploying PlayLoop to AWS

Do the steps in this order: some values only exist after an earlier step. Repeat everything with `prod` instead of `dev` for production.

## 0. Tools

- AWS CLI v2, logged in (`aws configure`), region `ap-southeast-1`
- AWS SAM CLI
- Docker

## 1. MongoDB Atlas

1. Create a cluster and a database user. Production needs a tier with daily backups (NFR-010); the free M0 tier has none.
2. Network access: allow `0.0.0.0/0` (App Runner has no fixed outbound IP without a VPC connector).
3. Connection string, with the database name: `mongodb+srv://…/playloop-dev?retryWrites=true` → `MONGODB_URI`.

## 2. Storage, CDN and the web build Lambda (SAM)

Run from `infra/`. The first deploy uses placeholders for the URLs that don't exist yet.

```bash
cd infra
sam build
sam deploy --config-env dev --parameter-overrides Env=dev ClientOrigins=http://localhost:5173 ApiUrl=https://example.invalid InternalWebhookSecret=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

Keep the generated secret: the API needs the same value. The stack outputs give you:

| Output               | API environment variable               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `MediaBucket`        | `S3_MEDIA_BUCKET`                      |
| `BuildsBucket`       | `S3_BUILDS_BUCKET`                     |
| `PlayBucket`         | `S3_PLAY_BUCKET`                       |
| `MediaCdnUrl`        | `MEDIA_CDN_URL`                        |
| `PlayCdnUrl`         | `PLAY_CDN_URL`                         |
| `BuildUnzipFunction` | `BUILD_UNZIP_FUNCTION`                 |
| `ApiAccessPolicyArn` | attach to the App Runner instance role |

## 3. API on App Runner (console)

1. Push the image (App Runner runs x86, so build for `linux/amd64`):

   ```bash
   aws ecr create-repository --repository-name playloop-api
   aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com
   docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -f server/Dockerfile -t <account>.dkr.ecr.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/playloop-api:dev --push .
   ```

2. Create an IAM role trusted by `tasks.apprunner.amazonaws.com` and attach `ApiAccessPolicyArn`.
3. Create the App Runner service from the ECR image: port `8080`, health check HTTP `/api/health`, instance role from step 2.
4. Environment variables: `NODE_ENV=production`, `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `INTERNAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `CLIENT_ORIGIN`, `AWS_REGION=ap-southeast-1`, and the stack outputs above. Put `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET` and `INTERNAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Secrets Manager and reference them (NFR-005). Do **not** set `S3_ENDPOINT` or AWS keys: the instance role provides access.
5. Redeploy the stack with the real API URL:

   ```bash
   sam deploy --config-env dev --parameter-overrides Env=dev ClientOrigins=http://localhost:5173 ApiUrl=https://<service>.ap-southeast-1.awsapprunner.com InternalWebhookSecret=<same secret>
   ```

## 4. Frontend on Amplify (console)

1. Connect the GitHub repo, app root `client`. Branch `develop` → dev, `main` → prod.
2. Rewrites and redirects (JSON), so the browser talks to the API on the same origin:

   ```json
   [
     {
       "source": "/api/<*>",
       "target": "https://<service>.ap-southeast-1.awsapprunner.com/api/<*>",
       "status": "200"
     },
     {
       "source": "</^[^.]+$|\\.(?!(css|gif|ico|jpg|js|png|txt|svg|woff|woff2|ttf|map|json|webp)$)([^.]+$)/>",
       "target": "/index.html",
       "status": "200"
     }
   ]
   ```

3. Set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` on App Runner to the Amplify URL, and redeploy the stack with `ClientOrigins=https://<branch>.<app>.amplifyapp.com` so browsers can upload straight to S3.

## 5. Smoke test

```bash
curl https://<amplify-url>/api/health
curl -i -X POST https://<amplify-url>/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"…","password":"…"}'
```

The login response **must** include a `Set-Cookie: playloop_token=…` header. If it doesn't, Amplify is dropping the cookie and login won't work. Then publish a game with a web build zip and check its status turns `ready` and it plays.

## How web builds are processed

1. The browser uploads the zip to the builds bucket (`POST /api/uploads` → PUT → `/complete`).
2. `POST /api/games/{gameId}/builds` creates the build as `processing` and invokes the Lambda asynchronously with the build id.
3. The Lambda unzips into the play bucket under `{buildId}/` (max 5,000 files, 2 GB unpacked, no unsafe paths, needs an `index.html`), sets Content-Type and Content-Encoding for Unity `.br`/`.gz` files, then calls `POST /api/internal/builds/{buildId}/status` signed with `INTERNAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
4. The game plays from `PLAY_CDN_URL/{buildId}/…`, a separate domain from the app.

Locally there is no Lambda: leave `BUILD_UNZIP_FUNCTION` empty and web builds stay `processing`.

## Known limits

- Rate limits are kept in memory per App Runner instance and keyed by IP. Behind Amplify, check that `req.ip` is the visitor's IP, not a CloudFront address.
- Godot 4 exports that use threads need cross-origin isolation, which an iframe can't provide here. Export without threads.
- Deleting or replacing a build doesn't delete its files from S3.
