# PlayLoop client

React + Vite frontend for PlayLoop. This package holds the app shell, routing, design tokens and the
base components exported from the Figma handoff board, plus the developer feedback workspace.
Other screens remain placeholders.

- Figma file: [PlayLoop](https://www.figma.com/design/m8i4PGK6yx0PwGw3aVkSUG/PlayLoop)
- Handoff board: **Frontend handoff / Base components** (node `427:1491`)
- Extracted sources: **Frontend handoff / component sources** (node `426:1488`)

## Getting started

Install from the repository root (npm workspaces), then start the client:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev:client
```

The app runs on http://localhost:5173. Requests to `/api` are proxied to the server on
http://localhost:4000 (`npm run services:up` and `npm run dev` from the root), so the
`playloop_token` session cookie works without CORS setup. To point somewhere else, copy
`.env.example` to `.env` and set `VITE_API_BASE_URL`.

In development, every base component is rendered with sample content at
http://localhost:5173/dev/components. That route is not included in production builds.

| Script (root)          | Script (client) | What it does                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev:client`   | `npm run dev`   | Vite dev server                  |
| `npm run build:client` | `npm run build` | Production build to `dist/`      |
| `npm run test:client`  | `npm test`      | Vitest + Testing Library (jsdom) |
| `npm run lint:client`  | `npm run lint`  | ESLint (React Hooks + Refresh)   |
| `npm run format`       | -               | Prettier for the whole repo      |

## Design tokens

`src/styles/tokens.css` defines every variable from the Figma collection with the same
`--playloop-*` names, so values can be checked against Figma one to one. Keep the names in sync
with Figma rather than renaming them. A few extra values used by the screens but not yet in Figma
are marked as **handoff supplements** (pink tag tone, compact button orange, grid line…).

Typography is exposed as font shorthands, one per Figma text style:

```css
.title {
  font: var(--playloop-type-card-title);
}
```

Fonts are self-hosted through Fontsource: **Kode Mono** (variable, 400–700) for all UI text and
**Palette Mosaic** for display headings.

Figma GLASS effects have no CSS equivalent. They are approximated with `backdrop-filter` tokens
(`--playloop-glass-soft`, `-panel`, `-frosted`), where a CSS blur is about half the Figma radius.

### Conventions

- **Styling**: one CSS Module per component, values from tokens. No CSS framework.
- **Polymorphic elements**: `Button`, `PrimaryButton`, `TextLink`, `GameCard`, `Recommendation`,
  `ReportRow` and `GlassPanel` take `as`. Use `as={Link} to="/…"` from `react-router` when the
  element navigates, and keep `<button>` when it acts.
- **Content stays outside layout**: titles, covers, tags and counts are props. Tags are passed as
  `[{ label, tone }]`; `toneForGenre()` in `lib/tagTones.js` returns the tone the screens use for a
  genre.
- **Slots**: `ReviewCard`, `ProfileHeader` and `ReportRow` take an `action`/`status` element so
  pages decide what the link or badge does.
- **Accessibility**: real `<label>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<kbd>` and checkbox elements; icon-only
  controls require a `label`; tabs support arrow keys; progress uses `role="progressbar"`.
- **Assets**: use the exported files in `src/assets`. Do not redraw the logo or icons. Sample covers
  and the portrait in `src/dev/samples` are demo content only; real images come from the API.

## Talking to the API

```js
import { api, ApiError } from '../lib/api.js';

const game = await api.get(`/games/${gameId}`);
await api.post('/auth/login', { email, password });
```

Requests include credentials, send JSON, and throw `ApiError` (`status`, `code`, `message`,
`details`) for non-2xx responses, matching the `Error` schema in `docs/api`.

## Routes

`src/routes.jsx` maps every high-fidelity screen to a placeholder that links to its Figma frame:
Explore Games, game description, review flow, published review, roulette, My Games
(publish/edit/published game), public and edit profile, log in, sign up and the admin pages.
Replace a placeholder's `element` with the real page when it is built.

## Open design questions

These come from the handoff board's "Still needing design decisions" list, plus gaps found while
building the components:

- Hover, pressed, disabled and loading states are not designed. Components only add a focus ring,
  50% opacity when disabled, and an underline on link hover.
- Field validation, success and empty states, and the open Select menu are not designed.
  `TextField` and `Textarea` accept `hint` and `error` with neutral placeholder styling.
- Mobile layouts and breakpoints are not defined. Navigation wraps below 1100 px.
- `ChoiceChip` uses KoHo in Figma (a legacy exception); it renders in Kode Mono here.
- Admin screens use a different shell (sidebar and admin header) that is not built yet.
- The sky background is the rendered 1512 × 1640 frame crop; very tall pages scale it to cover.

## Developer feedback workspace

The following screens are implemented from the PlayLoop Figma file:

| Route                              | Screen                                                       | Figma node           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| `/my-games`                        | Published games and drafts, review counts, workspace links   | `255:503`            |
| `/my-games/:gameId/form`           | First Impression, Playtest and Final Verdict form editor     | `272:630`, `272:749` |
| `/my-games/:gameId/feedback`       | Feedback filters, review details, status changes and replies | `270:606`            |
| `/games/:gameId/reviews`           | Sorted community reviews, helpful votes and discussion       | `318:860`            |
| `/reviews/:reviewId`               | Full review and discussion                                   | `318:860`            |
| `/games/:gameId/reviews/:reviewId` | Alias for notification links from the API                    | `318:860`            |

The navigation bell loads `/me/notifications`, polls the unread count once a minute while
signed in, and supports marking one or all notifications read. Escape and outside clicks close it.

The form builder supports every question type in `docs/api/schemas/form.yaml`, preserves edits
between tabs, validates all sections before saving, and warns before leaving unsaved edits.
Final Verdict's editable field is the farewell message; standard verdict questions are defined
by the backend. Figma currently provides only a wireframe for that editor and no bell dropdown,
so those surfaces compose the existing glass components and tokens.

All application data and writes use the cookie-authenticated API. No sample data or local-storage
fallback is included in the app. The complete backend endpoints are on `main`; this frontend
branch's older server does not yet include the newer auth, discussion and notification modules.
Use a backend built from current `main` to exercise the integrated flows. Game publishing/editing,
login and other existing placeholder screens remain separate work.

`src/test/featureFixtures.js` contains API-shaped data for tests only. Feature tests cover form
persistence and validation, failed requests, navigation guards, inbox status updates, votes,
replies and notifications. Browser checks use isolated local fixtures rather than live accounts.
The new Figma exports live in `src/assets/features`; game covers and user portraits remain dynamic.
